`tgfeed` converts Telegram channels into RSS or Atom feeds suitable for any RSS reader of your choice. It runs as a daemon and scrapes t.me channel pages, generating RSS or Atom feeds for each channel you put in the config. Resulting feeds can be served with any web server as static files.

## Usage

Running using Docker:

```shell
$ cp config.example.json config.json
# edit config.json to add channels usernames you want to read
$ mkdir cache feeds
$ docker compose up -d
$ # serve the contents of ./feeds folder generated by tgfeed
```

Example nginx config to serve generated feeds:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location /feeds/ {
        alias /var/www/tgfeed/feeds;
        autoindex on;
    }
}
```
